Descriptions for the things that are used in the player structure 

    #Scripts
    - PlayerBase ( The script that sets up the base of the player game object. initialization of stats and other managers
        will go in here along with things that multiple scripts might need like the rigidbody of the entity. )
    
        - PlayerController ( The script that will get the component that implements the IMovable interface and control
            when the player moves, this will be replaced with AI in enemies. )
    
        - PhysicsMovement ( The script that will contain the physics based movement, will implement the IMovable 
            interface, also contains an Event that will fire when movement is called that will pass the type of movement 
            that occured )
    
        - 
    
    - PlayerTestingScript ( Used to test the events that I am firing from the player Object )
